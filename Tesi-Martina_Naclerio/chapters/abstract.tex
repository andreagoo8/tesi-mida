Algae are promising organisms for the production of sustainable products to be used as raw materials for food, animal feed, chemicals, biofuels, and much more. In this period of change and demographic growth, it will be necessary to focus on the potential of these organisms as a sustainable food resource, also considering the European environmental regulations and commitment towards an Ecological Transition and a new concept of Blue Economy.
Initiatives such as the “EU Green Deal”, “Farm to Fork” and the “EU Algae Strategy” are just some examples promoting the adoption of more sustainable and environmentally friendly dietary practices. %#Andrea usare corsivo?
From an overview of the characteristics of algae, their cultivation methods, and their multiple uses, the benefits they offer for both human health and the ecosystem will be evident. Through an experimental project, the integration of algae into plant-based burgers has been examined, and by analyzing the nutritional and sensory aspects of this innovative food proposal, we seek to outline a path towards a more aware and sustainable future.
(When I have the results of the statistical analysis, I will add a more detailed section on what has been done, the main findings, and a conclusion section).
