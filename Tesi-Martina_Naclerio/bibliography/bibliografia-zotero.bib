  abstract = {Summary                              This paper describes a method of generalized discriminant analysis based on a dissimilarity matrix to test for differences in                a priori                groups of multivariate observations. Use of classical multidimensional scaling produces a low‐dimensional representation of the data for which Euclidean distances approximate the original dissimilarities. The resulting scores are then analysed using discriminant analysis, giving tests based on the canonical correlations. The asymptotic distributions of these statistics under permutations of the observations are shown to be invariant to changes in the distributions of the original variables, unlike the distributions of the multi‐response permutation test statistics which have been considered by other workers for testing differences among groups. This canonical method is applied to multivariate fish assemblage data, with Monte Carlo simulations to make power comparisons and to compare theoretical results and empirical distributions. The paper proposes classification based on distances. Error rates are estimated using cross‐validation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                              Hypothesis‐testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non‐parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non‐parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for                ANOVA                (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non‐parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non‐parametric methods. The test‐statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s                F                ‐ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix.                P                ‐values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Chlorella products contain numerous nutrients and vitamins, including D and B12, that are absent in plant-derived food sources. Chlorella contains larger amounts of folate and iron than other plant-derived foods. Chlorella supplementation to mammals, including humans, has been reported to exhibit various pharmacological activities, including immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic activities. Meta-analysis on the effects of Chlorella supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors have suggested that it improves total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose levels but not triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. These beneficial effects of Chlorella might be due to synergism between multiple nutrient and antioxidant compounds. However, information regarding the bioactive compounds in Chlorella is limited.},

The wet tissue is homogenized with a mixture of chloroform and methanol in such proportions that a miscible system is formed with the water in the tissue. Dilution with chloroform and water separates the homogenate into two layers, the chloroform layer containing all the lipids and the methanolic layer containing all the non-lipids. A purified lipid extract is obtained merely by isolating the chloroform layer. The method has been applied to fish muscle and may easily be adapted to use with other tissues.},

  abstract = {Palmaria palmata is an edible red macroalga widely used for human consumption and valued for its high protein value. Despite its low total lipid content, it is rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). This seaweed has been scarcely explored with regard to its lipid composition. The polar lipids of seaweeds are nowadays recognized as important phytochemicals contributing to their add value valorization and providing support for claims of potential health benefits. The present study aimed to disclose the polar lipid profile of P. palmata, farmed in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) through modern lipidomic approaches using high-resolution LC-MS and MS/MS and to screen for the antioxidant properties of this red macroalga. A total of 143 molecular species of lipids were identified, belonging to several classes of polar lipids, such as glycolipids, phospholipids, and betaine lipids. It is noteworthy that the most abundant lipid species in each class were esterified with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), accounting for more than 50\% of the lipid content. The polar lipid extract rich in EPA showed antioxidant activity with an inhibition concentration (IC) of IC30 = 171 ± 19.8 µg/mL for α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH●) and IC50 = 26.2 ± 0.1 µg/mL for 2,20-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical cation (ABTS●+). Overall, this study highlights that P. palmata farmed in an IMTA framework can be a sustainable source of beneficial lipids with antioxidant activity. Moreover, this red macroalga can be exploited for future applications as a source of lipids rich in EPA for food and feed, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics.},

Ancient cyanobacteria algae turned carbon dioxide into enormous sums of lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, while they secreted oxygen into the atmosphere. Over a billion years, as oxygen filled the air and algae filled the seas, animal life became possible. Eventually all that algae biomass became petroleum and natural gas, which for eons sat undisturbed in vast underground reservoirs, holding enormous sums of untapped energy. Less than 200 years ago humans learned to tap these energy reserves to create the world we know today, but in so doing, we have released millions of years of stored CO2 back into the atmosphere.

Algae are organisms that perform photosynthesis; that is, they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen (therefore they have chlorophyll, a group of green pigments used by photosynthetic organisms that convert sunlight into energy via photosynthesis) and live in water or in humid places. Algae have great variability and are divided into microalgae, small in size and only visible through a microscope, and macroalgae, which are larger in size, up to more than 50 m (the maximum recorded was 65 m), and have a greater diversity in the oceans. Thus, the term “algae” is commonly used to refer to “marine macroalgae or seaweeds”. It is estimated that 1800 different brown macroalgae, 6200 red macroalgae, and 1800 green macroalgae are found in the marine environment. Although the red algae are more diverse, the brown ones are the largest.},

Two basic strategies are employed for reducing CO2 emissions, viz. (i) a decrease in fossil fuel use, and increased use of renewable energy sources; and (ii) carbon sequestration by various biological, chemical, or physical methods. This review has explored microalgae’s role in carbon sequestration, the physiological apparatus, with special emphasis on the carbon concentration mechanism (CCM). A CCM is a specialized mechanism of microalgae. In this process, a sub-cellular organelle known as pyrenoid, containing a high concentration of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco), helps in the fixation of CO2. One type of carbon concentration mechanism in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the association of pyrenoid tubules with thylakoids membrane is represented through a typical graphical model. Various environmental factors influencing carbon sequestration in microalgae and associated techno-economic challenges are analyzed critically.},

  abstract = {Palmaria palmata, commonly referred to as dulse is a well-known and highly valued red macroalga distributed along the North Atlantic shores within a latitude range of approximately 40 to 80 °N. It is a species of commercial importance with historical records of use as food dating back several centuries to the current harvesting of dulse by hand-picking on the foreshore in Western Europe as well as Canada (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia) and USA (Maine). Because the demand for P. palmata increases and future sustainable commercial developments cannot rely solely on wild-harvested biomass, significant efforts have been made by research and industrial actors to cultivate the species. The low rates of spore release and germination, high mortality and epibiont contaminations remain major bottlenecks and point towards the need for optimized hatchery methods to enable upscaling the biomass production. The present review summarizes the available knowledge related to the biology, including the unique life history of the species among the Rhodophyta, the ecology as well as the nutrient composition and quality of P. palmata as food. Recent advances in taxonomy and cultivation techniques are reported along with a status of regulations for the commercial harvest of wild populations. An outlook on future industrial perspectives using biomass of P. palmata is also given.},

Algae possess the ability to fix carbon through photosynthesis and produce enormous biomass. The potential use of algae in bio-fertilizers, nutrient recycling, crop stimulants against abiotic stresses, and bio-control agent against plant pests provides a way forward for sustainable agriculture development. This chapter summarizes the use of algae in agriculture ranging from bio-fertilizers to crop stimulants. It is expected that the integration of algae in inputs will transform modern agriculture into a more environmentally benign and resource-efficient system, hence making it more productive.},
